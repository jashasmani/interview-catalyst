## Introduction

### Project Details
The "Interview Catalyst using Crowdsourcing Method" project is a comprehensive exploration into leveraging the power of crowdsourcing for enhancing the interview process. The aim of this project was to develop a platform that harnesses the collective intelligence and diverse perspectives of a crowd to optimize the interview experience for both interviewers and candidates. It helps candidates in smoothing their interview process.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the "Interview Catalyst using Crowdsourcing Method" project is to revolutionize and optimize the interview process by harnessing the collective intelligence and diverse perspectives of a crowd. By tapping into the collective knowledge and experience of a crowd, the project aims to unlock new insights and innovative approaches to candidate assessment. This collective intelligence has the potential to uncover qualities and skills that may be overlooked in traditional interview settings. In summary, the purpose of the "Interview Catalyst using Crowdsourcing Method" project is to create a transformative platform that redefines and improves the interview process, contributing to more effective hiring decisions and fostering a more inclusive and objective recruitment environment.

### Scope
The "Interview Catalyst using Crowdsourcing Method" project encompasses a wide range of functionalities and features, aiming to revolutionize the traditional interview process. Key aspects that fall within the project's scope include the development of a User-Friendly UI, Integration of Crowdsourcing Algorithms, Comprehensive Candidate Assessment, Scalability and Adaptability, Feedback Mechanism for Continuous Improvement, and Potential for AI Integration.

### Objective
The objective of the "Interview Catalyst Using Crowdsourcing" project is to develop a web application where there is only one best and single answer available for every question. Each answer includes the names of all the contributors who have contributed to the solution of a particular question. Additionally, a round-robin algorithm is implemented, allowing users to send requests to a moderator, and changes to answers are made only after moderator approval.
